                    Dear Participant,</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    You are invited to take part in an economic experiment, which is part of a project studying retail
                    trading platforms funded by the Canadian Securities Institute and the Social Sciences and Humanities
                    Research Council of Canada. You will be asked to trade assets on a virtual financial market.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. Participation presents no <b>known</b> risks
                    or
                    burdens. You will receive a compensation for participating in the study, announced on Prolific platform, as well as a
                    monetary compensation proportional to the profits you earn both in the process of trading and for
                    the completion of the non-trading task. You can withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.
                    However, if you withdraw before the end of the experiment the compensation will be forfeit, as per
                    Prolificâ€™s rules.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    Please be assured that all data generated during this study will remain confidential. You will be
                    asked to provide some basic demographic information about yourself, but none of this information
                    will in any way be used to personally identify you and no personal information will appear in any
                    published study.

                    Your decision to participate in this study will remain completely confidential and only the
                    researchers will have access to any of the individual data. We do not collect any data that can
                    personally identify you. Any demographics data will be stored electronically on a web-based server
                    until it is downloaded for the purpose of analysis. This server will only be accessible by the
                    research team using a secure password. Data will be retained in de-identifiable format for 7 years
                    and discarded afterwards. At that time, electronic files will be deleted and written files will be
                    shredded. This is a standard practice for the American Psychological Association. As required by the
                    guidelines of American Economic Association, during the publication process the data might be shared
                    with other investigators for re-analysis. However, to ensure security and confidentiality of the
                    data files only details of the computations sufficient to permit replication might be shared.
