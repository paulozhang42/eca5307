I've had to plug in answers that really don't apply to me (I don't have a portfolio; I don't know what leverage is) just to continue with this study, which after 53 minutes is not something I want to send back. If you decide to redo this please either make those questions optional or include a ""N/A"" answer choice.    Also - The moving bar was distracting at first but I got used to it. I had some trouble with the instructions but less than I thought I would. I was actually not expecting to get through the comprehension checks. I missed one the first time but was given another chance, which I appreciate.    I consider trading to be way too risky for someone with my income so I haven't tried it, but based on what I saw here I think it can be addictive. It's basically like playing a game - see if you can ""catch"" the price at the right point - except that the stakes can be really high. Trading has the potential to be a fast track to bankruptcy.    This was really interesting; I'm glad I got to do it.
